# Enigma Machine Simulator üîê

This project simulates the working of a World War II-era **Enigma Machine**, focusing on its encryption and decryption mechanics. The implementation includes rotors, a plugboard, a reflector, and a ring setting system. The goal is to replicate the core behavior of the Enigma machine ‚Äî namely, its symmetric encryption system where the same process is used for both encoding and decoding messages.

## Features

- **Rotor System Simulation**: Each rotor has its own internal wiring and notch settings. Rotors advance with each key press, changing the cipher dynamically.
- **Reflector Logic**: Implements a basic reflector that ensures encryption is symmetric.
- **Plugboard Support**: Configurable plugboard wiring enables letter substitutions both before and after the rotor transformations.
- **Real-Time Step Logging**: Each character's transformation is logged step-by-step for educational and debugging purposes.
- **Reset Functionality**: Allows resetting rotor positions to ensure proper decryption of previously encrypted text.
- **Modular Design**: Classes such as `ROTOR`, `RING`, and `ENIGMA_MACHINE` provide a modular and extensible architecture for customization.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kinglord1090/enigma-machine-simulator.git
   ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd enigma-machine-simulator
   ```
2. Run the simulation:
    ```bash
    python enigma-sim.py
    ```
3. The program will:
   - Initialize rotors with custom or default wiring.
   - Configure plugboard and ring settings.
   - Encrypt a hardcoded plaintext.
   - Reset the machine and decrypt the ciphertext back to the original message.
4. Observe the step-by-step transformation in the console output.
